## How to use GLMNET
## Usage: For large amount of corelated independent variables 
# http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet/glmnet_alpha.html

# Note glmnet with alpha=1 alpha=1 for Lasso only 
       glmnet with alpha=1 alpha=0 for Ridge only 
       glmnet with alpha between 0,1 ElasticNet
# Liniar regression have small error from Bias and large from a Variance
# This method will increase Bias but minimize the Variance
# The goal is to find optimal lambda which is a weight between Bias and Varaince
# When shrinkage parameter lambda is zero it becomes regular liniar regression
# With large penelty some some coeeficients will become zero in Lasso, but in Ridge
# they only approach zero.
