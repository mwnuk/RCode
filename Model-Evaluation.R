- R2 is the ratio between of the amount of variance explained by a regression model to the total variation of the data.
  It measures goodness of model.
  In Finance expect R2 in range 0.5-0.8, in Biology much lower in a range 0.005 -0.007
  R2=0.6 means that we reduced outcome variance around it means by 60%
- p value - probability that event happens negating  null Hypothesis - less then 0.05 - high probability
    values greater then 0.05 are not evidence against null hypothesis.
- t statistic merely measure how strong is the evidence that there is a nonzero association. 
   Even a weak effect can be extremely significant given enough data. Range 2-40, bigger better.
   By hand can be done using t-tests( 1-sample t-test, paired t-test,2-sample t-test) 
-F statistics - The F statistic tests the null hypothesis that none of the predictors has any effect. 
  Rejecting that null means concluding that *some* predictor has an effect, not that *all* of them do. Range 100-600. bigger better. 
-ANOVA( Analysis of Variance) - measures F-ratio, it is defined as the ratio of Mean Square(between groups) 
  to Mean Square(within groups)
- Chi-square Goodness of fit when outcome is categorical. It is used top calculated p-value and then judge the null hypothesis.

Is at least one predictor useful?
 F statistics is large


Which predictors are important?
 p value 

How good is the model?

LINIAR MODEL SELECTION 

In essence
if you have milion observations on 4 varaibles - do the least square
if you have 400 variables and 300 observations (p>n) need to reduce amount of features in 3 ways:
1. SUBSET SELECTION
     - best subset selection, consider every possible subset of p, and pick the best (CrossValidation, Cp,AIC,BIC,AdjustedR2 etc), good method for p<40
     - Forward StepWise methods - start with no predictors, add one p at a time, picking p wich will give the best model, total=p^2 models
     - Backward StepWise method - select all predictors, remove on p at a time, picking p wich will give the best model
             Estimate Test Error
               1. Indirectly compute training error - Cp,AIC,BIC,adjusterR2 - want them all small, but adjustedR2 as large as possible
               2. Directly estimate test error - validation and cross validation, 
          
2. SHRIKAGE parameters put penalty on the size of predictors
     - Ridge - lambda - shrinkage parameter, when lambda=0 same as least square method
     - Lasso
           lambda selection: split model in to 10 parts, 
                             for 9 parts apply Ridge,Lasso with whole range of lambda
                             record error on 10th part
                             do it 10 times, add up all records, get CrossValidation curve as a function of lambda 

    
3. DIMENSION REDUCTION - extracting important combination of variables 
     -Principal Component Regression - liniar combination of original predictor ( part of Unsupervised Learning)  - pick the direction( as a component) where data varies the most 
     -Partial Least Squares - select components in a suprvised way, chose components by looking at the response

VALIDATION
	-TEST ERROR is the error we incur on a new data, that the model hasn't seen.
	-TRAINING ERROR is the error we we get applying the model to the same data it was trained from.
      - Ingredients of e prediction error are
               - bias - how far off on average the model is from the truth
               - variance - how much that estimate varies around its average
	-CROSS_VALIDATION gives good idea about test error of the model
      -LOOCV- Leave One Out Cross Validation - specail case when we don't have to refit the model at all. Training sets differ by 
              one observation, so they are very similar. 
	-BOOTSTRAP VALIDATION is useful to get idea of the variability of sd of en estimate and its bias,
              it samples from a dataset with replacement, it treats dataset like it would be entire population
Error is measured by
 - Mean Square Error  for Quantitative response
 - MissClassification Error Rate - for Discret Response Classification from Confusion Matrix
